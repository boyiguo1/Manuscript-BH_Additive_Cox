\section{Discussion}

- Summarize the contribution

- Summarize the study results
  - Simulation shows prediction wise improvement
  - Variable selection wise
  - COmputation speed wise

Flexible modeling, do not need prior test for linear effects.

We could test other Particularly relavent to survival outcomes, in addition, we consider various settings of censoring rate, underlying distributions of baseline hazard function, which include commonly used familyes, Exponential, Weibull, Gumptry.

Discussing the coefficient structure, and link back to the previous manuscript.

From the software perspective, the proposed model can be easily extend to delayed entry, stratified Cox models. Explain why and how.


The model can be expanded to accomondate more complicated functional covartiates via transformaiton. . Such complex functional covariates include domain-specific transofrmation and subject-specfic transformation (Cui, Crainiceanu, Leroux). Such modeling strategy have great potention in wearable devcies data analysis. This expansion is feasible with tensor product method in mgcv.


How to include time dependent covariates and time varying effects.
