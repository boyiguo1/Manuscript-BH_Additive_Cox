\section{Discussion}
In this article, we introduce the two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior to Cox additive models for high-dimensional survival data analysis. Specifically, the proposed spike-and-slab LASSO prior adopts the sparse penalty to select effective predictors and the smooth penalty to estimate the degree of smoothness of the underlying nonlinear function. This mechanism address previous criticism that models that doesn't account smooth penalty tends to oversmooth the estimate of the underlying linear function. Meanwhile, the two-part prior encourages a bi-level selection of each predictor, select the predictor in the model and the linearity of the underlying additive function of the predictor. In addition to the model, we propose a optimization-based algorithm to the proposed Bayesian hierarchical model to provide a scalable model fitting solution to the Bayesian models. This substantially reduced computational demands in comparison to posterior approximation algorithms. Lastly, we provide the implementation of the proposed model and fitting algorithm in a freely available R package \texttt{BHAM} via \url{https://github.com/boyiguo1/BHAM}, along with many other utility functions to support model fitting, tuning, and diagonistic.

Similar to many machine learning algorithms that provides flexible modeling of complex signal, the proposed model requires no prior checking. This is because the model can automatically choose from linear and nonlinear effects of a predictor, and the decision is driven by the data, as the underlying penalty is locally adaptive, depending on the data. Nevertheless, we still encourage the authors relies on domain knowledge to decides variable selection, or construct more than one model when domain knownledge does not exist. [TODO: add a sentence on why, bi-level seleciton could include false positive component of the complex function. For example, when the underlying model include no linear component, e.g. $x^2$, the proposed model still tends to include a linear effect in the model.] This phenomenon is because of the effect hierarchy we impose on the prior structure. In other words, we encourage the model to include the linear component when the nonlinear effect is detected. A viable solution, is to consider the inclusion of the linear and nonlinear effect independent. Nevertheless, this could result in other intended consequences, for example xxxx. [TODO: double check with the GLM results]. Hence, our suggestion is to lean on the domain knowledge to decides, and also check the curve when the objective to use the model to conduct predictor selection.

In this article, we only shows the most basic survival model without mentioning some other analytic problem likely to encournter in survival analysis, for examplem delayed entry, stratified Cox models. This analytic problem can be easily addressed and implmenented under the current model framework. Another important extension of the proposed model is to model time varying effect. Such extension requires minium modification: one can simply construct the basis matrix for the time, and multiply with the covariates. We see similar strategy was applied in Wang et al. xxx. IN our future work. The model can be expanded to accomondate more complicated functional covartiates via transformaiton. . Such complex functional covariates include domain-specific transofrmation and subject-specfic transformation (Cui, Crainiceanu, Leroux). Such modeling strategy have great potention in wearable devcies data analysis. This expansion is feasible with tensor product method in mgcv.

In conclusion, we proposed a new Bayesian hierarhical model to address Cox additive model in high-dimensional settings, and provide a software implmentation of the proposed model. The model fitting algorithm is easily scalable. THe provides xxx for clinical and molecular data analysis.
