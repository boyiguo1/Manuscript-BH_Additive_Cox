\section{introduction}

% We defer the review of high-dimensional Cox model to \cite{xu2012} and the triage of flexible Cox model in biomedical data analysis to \cite{Lin2013}.

%for Cox model in the high-dimensional setting is non-trivial. Specifically, how to decide if a function form of predictor should be included and what the appropriate form is extremely challenge as how to balance the signal sparsity and function smoothness is unclear. 


To leverage the fact that the probability of selecting the bases of a smooth function should be similar, we have the linear and nonlinear components (if selected) share the inclusion probability $\theta_j$.
