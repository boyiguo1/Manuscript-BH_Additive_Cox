@article{Leng2006,
abstract = {We propose a novel model selection method for a nonparametric extension of the Cox proportional hazard model, in the framework of smoothing splines ANOVA models. The method automates the model building and model selection processes simultaneously by penalizing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norms. On the basis of a reformulation of the penalized partial likelihood, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the estimate. The solution demonstrates great flexibility and easy interpretability in modeling relative risk functions for censored data. Adaptive choice of the smoothing parameter is discussed. Both simulations and a real example suggest that our proposal is a useful tool for multivariate function estimation and model selection in survival analysis.},

@article{Du2010,
abstract = {We study the Cox models with semiparametric relative risk, which can be partially linear with one nonparametric component, or multiple additive or nonadditive nonparametric components. A penalized partial likelihood procedure is proposed to simultaneously estimate the parameters and select variables for both the parametric and the nonparametric parts. Two penalties are applied sequentially. The first penalty, governing the smoothness of the multivariate nonlinear covariate effect function, provides a smoothing spline ANOVA framework that is exploited to derive an empirical model selection tool for the nonparametric part. The second penalty, either the smoothlyclipped-absolute- deviation (SCAD) penalty or the adaptive LASSO penalty, achieves variable selection in the parametric part. We show that the resulting estimator of the parametric part possesses the oracle property, and that the estimator of the nonparametric part achieves the optimal rate of convergence. The proposed procedures are shown to work well in simulation experiments, and then applied to a real data example on sexually transmitted diseases. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2010.},

@article{Lin2013,
abstract = {Prognosis plays a pivotal role in patient management and trial design. A useful prognostic model should correctly identify important risk factors and estimate their effects. In this article, we discuss several challenges in selecting prognostic factors and estimating their effects using the Cox proportional hazards model. Although a flexible semiparametric form, the Cox's model is not entirely exempt from model misspecification. To minimize possible misspecification, instead of imposing traditional linear assumption, flexible modeling techniques have been proposed to accommodate the nonlinear effect. We first review several existing nonparametric estimation and selection procedures and then present a numerical study to compare the performance between parametric and nonparametric procedures. We demonstrate the impact of model misspecification on variable selection and model prediction using a simulation study and an example from a phase III trial in prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Govindarajulu2007,
abstract = {The additive hazards model is one of the most commonly used regression models in the analysis of failure time data and many methods have been developed for its inference under various situations. This paper discusses the situation where one faces current status data and also there exists informative censoring or when the failure time of interest and the observation process are correlated. Several authors have discussed the problem and in particular, Zhang et al. (2005) and Zhao et al. (2015) proposed an estimating equationbased approach and a copula model-based method, respectively. However, the former may not be efficient and the latter needs some restrictive assumptions. To address these, we propose a sieve maximum likelihood estimation approach that can be more efficient and also does not require the assumption above. For the implementation of the method, an EM algorithm is developed and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method works well in practical situations and an application is provided.},

@article{Govindarajulu2009,
abstract = {We examined the behavior of alternative smoothing methods for modeling environmental epidemiology data. Model fit can only be examined when the true exposure-response curve is known and so we used simulation studies to examine the performance of penalized splines (P-splines), restricted cubic splines (RCS), natural splines (NS), and fractional polynomials (FP). Survival data were generated under six plausible exposure-response scenarios with a right skewed exposure distribution, typical of environmental exposures. Cox models with each spline or FP were fit to simulated datasets. The best models, e.g. degrees of freedom, were selected using default criteria for each method. The root mean-square error (rMSE) and area difference were computed to assess model fit and bias (difference between the observed and true curves). The test for linearity was a measure of sensitivity and the test of the null was an assessment of statistical power. No one method performed best according to all four measures of performance, however, all methods performed reasonably well. The model fit was best for P-splines for almost all true positive scenarios, although fractional polynomials and RCS were least biased, on average.

@article{Gray1992,
abstract = {In this article some flexible methods for modeling censored survival data using splines are applied to the problem of modeling the time to recurrence of breast cancer patients. The basic idea is to use fixed knot splines with a fairly modest number of knots to model aspects of the data, and then to use penalized partial likelihood to estimate the parameters of the model. Test statistics are proposed which are analogs of those used in traditional likelihood analysis, and approximations to the distributions of these statistics are suggested. In an analysis of a large data set taken from clinical trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, these methods are seen to give useful insight into how prognosis varies as a function of continuous covariates, and also into how covariate effects change with follow-up time. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},
