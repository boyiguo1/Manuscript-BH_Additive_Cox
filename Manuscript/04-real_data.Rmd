\section{Metabolites Data Analysis}
In this section, we apply the proposed model BHAM to analyze a previously published metabolically dataset to study plasma metabolomic profile on the all-cause mortality among patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. The data set is publicly available via Dryad. The dataset contains data collected from two cohorts and there exists a large number of non-overleapping among metabolomic profile measured  in the two cohort. Hence, we focus our analysis on the cohort that have the larger sample size (N=454). To achieve practically meaningful analysis, we select the top 200 features with largest variance from the initial 6796 features to conduct our analysis. We use 5-knot cubic splines as the additive function in the proposed Cox additive model. Optimal tuning parameters are chosen via 10-fold CV. Out-of-bag samples are used to evaluate prediction performance, where we primary focus on deviance and concordance statistics. To visualize the risk prediction, we also create two groups based on the out-of-bad risk prediction, thresholding at the median risk and labeled low-risk group and high-risk group. The Kaplan-Meier plot for the two group is presented in Figure xx.
